Salesforce Security Model  

Hello, today i will be taking a quick look at Salesforce security model.

At the top level there is organization level scurity such as trusted IP ranges, 
Login hours to make sure that connections only occur during specified times,
and Multi-factor authentication as if 1 password is not enough then make it also require a key.

Next we have object level security, controlling who has access to specific objects.  
Profiles are the base level set defining what actions users are able to perform, such as create, read, update and delete.
Permission are a second level of rules that add flexibility by expanding what is allowed without changing the profile.

Field level security controls access to individual fields to help control access to secure information by making it either read only or completely hidden. 

Then Record level security, controlling who has access to specific records.
Tools such as Org wide rules, role hierarchies, sharing rules and manual sharing are used here.
Org wide rules define the baseline access to records and this should be set as the most restrictive
Adding in role hierarchies to allow those up the hierarchie tree to see those within their chain.
sharing rules grant additional access based upon criteria.
and manual sharing lets records be shared on specific records.

In Summary Salesforce security model is layered so that users only have access to the information that they need for their job helping to mantain data integrity.
Thank you.
