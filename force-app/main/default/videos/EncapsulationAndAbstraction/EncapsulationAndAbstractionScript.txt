Title: Understanding Encapsulation and Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming

Hello everyone! Today, I will be discussing two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming: encapsulation and abstraction.

Let's start with encapsulation. Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data, and methods that operate on that data into a single object. 
It helps protect data by hiding it from direct access outside the class and controlling how it is accessed. 
This allows rules and constraints to ensure data integrity. 

Here i created a class that not only has information from a sObject record but also meta data about the sObject.

Next, let's discuss abstraction. Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. 
This is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. 
An abstract class provides a simplified view of an object, focusing on essential features, which enhances code reusability and maintainability.

A classic example of abstraction is a vehicle. All vehicles have some data in common, making them fundamental features of a vehicle. 
Functions related to speed can be used by any subclass, whether it's a car, boat, or plane. 
Additionally, abstract methods can be extended in different ways depending on the specifics. 
For instance, a car doesn't need to worry about altitude, but for a plane, this is crucial.

In summary, encapsulation and abstraction are key to effective programming. 
They help make code easier to create and maintain by ensuring data integrity, improving readability, and enhancing reusability.

Thank you for your time.
