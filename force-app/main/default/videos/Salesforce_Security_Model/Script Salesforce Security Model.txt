Salesforce Security Model  

Hello, today i will be taking a quick look at Salesforce security model.

At the start, Salesforce offers Organization-Level Security 
with measures like login IP ranges, login hours, and trusted IPs to control access to the org. 
Salesforce also has multiple ways to enhance login security such as password restrictions and authentication keys.

Object-Level Security through profiles and permission sets determines which objects users can access 
and what actions they can perform, such as create, read, update, or delete.

Field-Level Security further refines access by specifying which fields within objects users can see or edit. 
Record-Level Security uses mechanisms like role hierarchies, sharing rules, and manual sharing 
to control data visibility at the record level, 
ensuring users can only access records they need for their role.

Each mechanism starts off most restrictive and adds additional access as needed by the user.

These restrictions are enforced in many ways, 
page layouts may change what is displayed but the fields themselves still need to have security enforced on them.
code needs to include things such as "with sharing" and "stripInnaccessible"

Additionally there are other features not mentioned frequently such as
Salesforce provides Audit Trail and Field History Tracking to monitor changes and ensure accountability. 

In Summary Salesforce security model is layered so that users only have access to the information that they need for their job helping to mantain data integrity.
Thank you.
