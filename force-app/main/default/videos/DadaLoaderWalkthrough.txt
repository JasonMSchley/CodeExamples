I am going to walk through all the steps for this task 
starting with data loader.
first step in the task is to log into dataloader.io 
with my org username and password

i need to then download data of all Account Records 
that have open opportunties with an ammount greater then 50k.

start with 
New Task, Export, targeting account, next
add a SOQL query
"
SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id IN  (
    SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity WHERE IsClosed = FALSE AND Amount > 50000
     )
"
This selects accounts where the account has an opportunity that is not closed 
and has the amount of greater then 50k, 
Verify and Next, then Save and Run
waiting for the task to run
or i can just download the version of the task i ran previously
and upload it into excel
Add the rating field,
and set all of these to Hot
then file, export, and download this sheet as CSV
and back to data loader to upload these records to the org
New task, Import

targeting account
upload CSV
and here we verify that the fields are correct, 
next
save and run
refresh the screen
and then verify that the account change has occured
