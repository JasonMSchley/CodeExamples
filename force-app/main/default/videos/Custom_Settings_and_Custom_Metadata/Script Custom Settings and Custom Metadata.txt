Custom Settings and Custom Metadata in Salesforce 

Both custom settings and custom metadata can be used to store list data within an org
These both can be used for storing information referenced in other locations almost like a public variable.

Custom setting is limited in that it is defined in an org and cant be easily transfered to another org
it can not be added to packages or change sets.
It is stored similiar to custom object in that the format of the object is created 
but the data itself is stored on a record.

Custom metadata is stored as a single item with data stored as part of the object and can be used in packages or change sets.
It also supports lookup between different custom metadata types.

In general it is recommended to use custom metadata unless you need to use specific features of custom settings
such as allowing hierarchy based seetings.

Thank you.
