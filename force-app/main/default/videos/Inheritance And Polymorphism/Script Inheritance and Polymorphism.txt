Title: Inheritance and Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming

Hello everyone! Today, I will be discussing inheritance and polymorphism. 
Two concepts in object oriented programming.

First off we have inheritance. 

Abstract classes that i talked about in the previous video are a type of inheritance 
with the exception that Abstract classes can have abstract methods, 
which more guidelines for future methods then actual methods by themselves 
and therefor can not be instantiated.

An Animal would be an abstract class having methods 
that are required but are too vague need to code such as a makeSound() method.
A class of Cat could then extend animal method to overright the method to make a "Meow".
And a dog class could then imherite the cat class features 
and just replace the ones that are different, such as makeSound() to make a "Woof"
This allows a developer to make a tree of classes reducing code.

Polymorphism is a way to overload methods. 
Allowing the developer to create multiple different versions of code.
Since there are multiple different ways to add 2 things together.
Integer, Double, 3 doubles, Strings
These examples show that they are receiving different types and quantities of input ,
then outputting the coresponding types.
This makes coding easier then using different methods with the same name within a class 
rather then having multiple methods doing the same type of thing 
such as AddInt, Adddouble, Add3Double, or AddString.
Polymorphism adds flexibility to code allowing it to be used for whatever is needed.

In summary these are 2 more fundamental concepts in object oriented programming that makes complex code easier to make and use.

Thank you for your time.
